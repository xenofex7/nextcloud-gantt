# ncGantt

A Nextcloud app that views and updates Deck boards in a Gantt chart.


This App is under development - use it at your own risk. It adds text to the description of a Deck card containing the start date and the progress when you change one of these parameters in the Gantt app! This is because Deck does not yet have these parameters natively implemented.


It uses the [frappe-gantt library](https://github.com/frappe/gantt) and is inspired by [NxDeckGantt](https://github.com/jeobz/NxDeckGantt) and [Deck2Gantt](https://gitlab.opencode.de/wuerzburg/deck2gantt).

## Features

A Deck board like this:

is shown as a Gantt chart like that:

The time range and progress of a card can be changed by dragging the bar or its handles with the mouse. The numbers in parentheses (e.g., 6/7) next to the titles indicate the number of checked checkboxes out of the total in the description — just like in Deck. The green check mark symbol synchronize with the “Done” field of Deck. It is automatically set when the progress is changed to 100%. A red exclamation mark denotes delay.

Clicking on a bar opens a popup with the card description:

You can edit the description by clicking on the pencil or in the text:

Every interaction is synchronized with Deck via the Deck API. Also changes in Deck lead to an update of the Gantt chart, so one can have both Apps open and use them simultaneously, i.e. create a card in Deck and then move it to the right position in time in Gantt.
